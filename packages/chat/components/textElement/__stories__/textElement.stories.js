      content="Abraham Lincoln was an American lawyer, politician, and statesman who served as the 16th [president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) from 1861 until his [assassination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln) in 1865.
 Lincoln led the United States through the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War), defending the nation as a constitutional [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)), defeating the insurgent [Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America), playing a major role in the [abolition of slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States), expanding the power of the [federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States), and modernizing the [U.S. economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States).
Lincoln was born into poverty in a [log cabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_cabin) in [Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky) and was raised on the [frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_frontier), mainly in [Indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana).
 He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. representative from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in Springfield, Illinois.
 In 1854, angered by the Kansasâ€“Nebraska Act, which opened the territories to slavery, he re-entered politics.
 He soon became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas.
 Lincoln ran for president in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory."></clabs-chat-text>`,
