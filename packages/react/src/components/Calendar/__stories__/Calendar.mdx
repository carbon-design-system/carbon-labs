## Overview

The calendar is a full-page component that provides the users with a view of a selected month, week or day. The calendar can be used to display events in a summarized month view, or as a granular breakdown of days by hourly increments. The specified month, week or day that is displayed can be controlled through the mini calendar view or by using the arrows to jump to the previous or next date or date range. The user can also jump to the current date to see today’s information.
