## Overview

`Resizer` is an atomic component extracted from `SplitPanel` and made into an independent component, which can be reused wherever there is a resizing requirement in the UI.

The `Resizer` captures the sibling sizes internally and resets on double-click. This behavior can be overridden by using `onDoubleClick` to handle any custom functionality.

The handle trigger cue can be enhanced if needed by writing a pseudo-class to make the trigger easier to grab, as seen in the stories.

A gap can be added to the parent if the design demands.

The minimum inline size or block size of the panels can be customized based on the design requirements.

For any kind of custom functionality, the component provides a callback `onResize`, which gives access to `delta`, the difference in mouse or keyboard movements relative to the initial position. along with the `event`.

Since most parts of this component are designed to be headless and unopinionated, it can be extensively tweaked, providing opportunities for various custom implementations.

## A11y

The resizer is primarily a visual enhancement and may offer limited benefit for screen-reader users, as the core UI elements remain accessible. However, for improved screen reader support, developers can apply their own custom aria-label to the resizer component ref available in `onResizeEnd` callback. This enables users to receive live feedback on layout changes. A reference implementation of this approach is included in the `Single Panel Bounded` example.

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

import { Resizer } from '@carbon-labs/react-resizer/es/index';

function App() {
  return <Resizer />;
}

export default App;
```

### SCSS

In your styles file import

```
@use '@carbon/react';
@use '@carbon-labs/react-resizer/scss/resizer';
```
