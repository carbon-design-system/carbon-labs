## Overview

This component is used to split an area horizontally or vertically. It renders
two panels `childrenBeforeSplit` and `childrenAfterSplit` with a split handle in
between.

The split handle can be moved using the mouse or keyboard.

### Mouse interaction

The split handle can be dragged between the minimum to maximum values.

### keyboard interaction

When the split handle has focus it can be moved using the cursor keys. A
secondary mode, typically used for moving at a different speed can be activated
by pressing shift at the same time. The default movement sizes are 5px without
shift and 25px with shift.

The Home/End keys move the split to the splitMin/splitMax values respectively.
The default splitMin is 0, splitMax 100.

### Events

The onChange event reports the current split value. It may be wise to monitor
this event and disable interactive controls when a panel is too small to be
practical.

<Canvas of={SplitPanelStories.Default} />

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

```bash
yarn add @carbon/react
yarn add @carbon-labs/react-split-panel
```

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import { SplitPanel } from '@carbon-labs/react-split-panel/es/index';

function App() {
  return (
    <SplitPanel
      childrenBeforeSplit={
        <div>
          <h2>Children before split</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>One</li>
            <li>Two</li>
            <li>Three</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      }
      childrenAfterSplit={
        <div>
          <h2>Children after split</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Apple</li>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Pear</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      }
      {...args}
    />
  );
}

export default App;
```

### SCSS

In your styles file import

````
@use '@carbon/react';
@use '@carbon-labs/react-split-panel/scss/split-panel';
```./SplitPanel.stories
````

## Panel backgrounds and layers

Like the tile component the panels of the SplitPanel component are set to the
current layer color. You should not modify this directly, doing so may affect
the visibility of the split handle. Where you are using the SplitPanel component
inside a layer, simply wrap with a layer component.
