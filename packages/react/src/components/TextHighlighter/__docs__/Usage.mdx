## Overview

The TextHighlighter component is a valuable tool for improving the user experience by making content more digestible, scannable, and engaging. It helps users quickly identify and focus on the most important information within your web pages. Text highlighters can also be used to compare different versions of a document/artifacts by visually indicating insertions and deletions. To support different use cases, TextHighlighter comes in three variants - `mark`, `ins`(Insertion), and `del`(Deletion). 

### When to use

- **Highlighting keywords in search results or within content:** If you're displaying search results within your site or want to emphasize terms related to a user's search within a document, highlighting those keywords can significantly improve usability.
- **Version comparison:** To see the differences between versions at a glance, highlighters can be a used.
- **Improving scanability of long-form content:** In lengthy articles, reports, or documentation, strategically highlighting key phrases or summary sentences can help users quickly grasp the main points without reading every word.
- **Providing context in code snippets:** Highlighting specific lines or variables in code examples can draw attention to the part being discussed.
- **Interactive highlighting for user selection:** Allowing users to highlight text themselves can be useful for copying, annotating, or focusing on specific sections.

### When not to use

- **Overuse:** Highlighting too much text defeats the purpose. If everything is highlighted, nothing stands out, and it can become visually overwhelming and distracting.
- **Purely Decorative Purposes:** Avoid using highlighting simply to add visual flair without a clear functional benefit. It can be confusing and will look unprofessional.
- **Use all variants together:** Refrain from using all variants simultaneously. While the `ins`(Insertion) and `del`(Deletion) variants are intended for comparison and can be used together, avoid using the `mark` variant alongside them within a comparison context, as this could lead to confusion.

### Variants

## Formatting

### Anatomy

A Text Highlighter component is generally comprised of the following elements:
- **Text (or Content):** This is the base content within which specific portions are to be highlighted. It can be a single word, a phrase, a sentence, or even a larger block of text.
- **Highlighted Segment(s):** These are the specific portions of the text that have been visually emphasized. They are distinguished from the surrounding text by a different background color, text color, or other styling.
- **Highlight Style (or Visual Indicator):** This defines how the highlighted segments appear. The `mark` variant offers various color themes. In contrast, the `ins`(Insertion) variant is consistently green with a dashed border, while the `del`(Deletion) variant is always red with a strike-through.

## Content

The text highlighted can vary depending on the contextâ€”it may include headings, body content, or labels.

### Further guidance

For further content guidance, see Carbon's
[content guidelines](<[https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/general)>).

## Mark

The `mark` variant highlights content intended for review, annotation, or special attention. The Mark variant is designed for non-semantic highlighting.

<img alt="mark variant" src={MarkVariant} />

</Column>
</Row>

## Ins & Del
The `ins`(Insertion) variant is used to denote newly added text in a document. Conversely, the `del`(Deletion) variant marks text that has been removed. Both are commonly employed for comparison or revision purposes. The `ins`(Insertion) and `del`(Deletion) variants are used to semantically indicate edits or changes to the text.

</Column>
</Row>

## Modifiers

### Reference annotation
The Reference Annotation allows users to tag a group of highlighted text segments with a brief, unique identifier. This identifier appears as a superscript next to the highlighted content. The `reference` property only applies to the `mark` variant. You can use symbol or max of 3 characters.
<Row>
<Column colLg={8}>
<img alt="referece annotaion" src={ReferenceAnnotation} />
<Caption>Example of referece annotaion - text highlighter.</Caption>
</Column>
</Row>

### Highlighter Colors
The Mark variant is used for non-semantic highlighting, so it comes in a variety of different colors, with values from the IBM Design Language [color palette](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color/) using [tag component tokens](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/color/tokens/#tag).
