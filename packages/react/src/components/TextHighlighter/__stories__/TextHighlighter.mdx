## Overview

The text highlighter feature enhances user experience by improving readability, focus, and engagement with the content. This feature is especially beneficial in various contexts such as version comparison, commenting, documentation etc

***It’s crucial that we use HTML semantics appropriately to represent the text highlighters, as improper usage could lead to a negative user experience. We must ensure effective communication to users utilizing assistive technologies, necessitating careful control over the markup.***

### Here we have a component offering 3 variants:

- 1st variant - `<mark>` : This HTML element represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes.
- 2nd variant - `<ins>` : This HTML element represents a range of text that has been added to a document. (Comparison purpose)
- 3rd variant - `<del>` : This HTML element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. (Comparison purpose)

<Canvas of={TextHighlighterStories.Default} />
