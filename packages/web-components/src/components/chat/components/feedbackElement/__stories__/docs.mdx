## Overview
<a id="overview"></a>

The Chat component is a collaboration between the **IBM Research Visual AI Lab
(VAIL)** and the **Carbon Design Team** to provide an open-source, easily
expandable chat interface to interact with large language models. Our core
values are: open-source collaboration, universal support, ease of use and the
in-depth customization Carbon is known for.

The **Carbon Labs popup** component aims to render any JSON defintiion provided
by the parent to display an informative popup component which provides detailed
feedback about the target response/content.

### Troubleshooting

  popup-title="Custom title"
  tag-list="['choice A','choice B', 'choice C']"

``` ### Setting values with a JSON definition

Place JSON defintion in Chat as `feedbackDefinitions` or Popup as
`feedbackFormValues`:

```json

    "title": "Unsatisfactory Response",
    "tags": [
      "Inaccurate",
      "Incomplete",
      "Missing links",
      "Privacy violations",
      "Hate speech"
    ],
    "prompt": "What was unsatisfactory about this response?",
    "responsePlaceholder": "Describe issues with this response"
  },
  "thumbs-up": {
    "title": "Feedback",
    "tags": ["Accurate", "Comprehensive", "Consice", "Easy to Understand"],
    "prompt": "Why did you choose this rating?",
    "responsePlaceholder": "Add a comment"
  }
}
```

### Styles

You'll also need to import the theming tokens from `@carbon/styles` either from
npm or from our CDN helpers. Checkout our Stackblitz example above to see how
that is implemented.
