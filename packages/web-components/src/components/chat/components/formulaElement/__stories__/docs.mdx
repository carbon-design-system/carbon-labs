# Carbon AI Chat: Formula

> **NOTE: Chat components that reached "preview candidate" status are in the process of graduating to a stable library! If you are starting out new or currently using the existing Carbon Labs version, we recommend going to #carbon-ai-chat to request access to the new library.**
>
> **The chat components in Carbon Labs that reached "preview candidate" status will continue to be supported here until they are fully migrated to the new location.**

* **Initiative owner(s):** Owen Cornec
* **Status:** Draft
* **Target library:** TBD
* **Target library maintainer(s) / PR Reviewer(s):** N/A
* **Support channel:** `#carbon-labs`

Mathematical formulas are essential to clearly let users understand how the model reasoned for any problem requiring mathematical reasoning:
* How many 8x8 inch tiles to cover with 20x42ft patio? *
* How many days until march 25th 2028? *
* Which planet is closest to earth on average given all orbits? *

These rely on LaTeX - the common language in all Academic/Research publication processes. It's extensive use makes it ideal for LLM-generation
