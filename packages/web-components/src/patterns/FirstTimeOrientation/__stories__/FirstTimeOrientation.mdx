## Overview

The first-time orientation pattern is built using  [InterstitialScreen component](https://ibm-products-web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-interstitialscreen--overview) component from `@carbon/ibm-products-web-components`
 of the Carbon for IBM Product's library. 

First-time orientation happens from the moment a user gains access to the product, post login, and guides them to realizing the productâ€™s primary value.
 The pattern consist of a welcome interstitial and a personalization interstitial. Personalization interstitial uses SelectableTag from Carbon. You can find more details in our [website](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/patterns/onboarding-flows/orientation/usage/).
